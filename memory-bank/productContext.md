# Product Context: Paint

## Why this project exists?
The goal is to provide a simple, performant, and cross-platform (starting with macOS) painting application built with C++ and SFML. It serves as a demonstration of C++ software engineering practices and graphical programming.

## Problems it solves
- Provides a canvas for digital drawing.
- Demonstrates integration of SFML with a CMake-based build system on macOS ARM64.
- Offers a starting point for more complex graphical applications.

## How it should work
- The user opens the application.
- A window appears with a drawing surface.
- The user can use the mouse to draw on the surface.
- (Future) Tools for different colors, brush sizes, and shapes.

## User Experience Goals
- Low latency drawing (responsive to mouse input).
- Clean and intuitive interface.
- Easy to build and run from source.
